In this powerful work, Ibsen places his main characters, Dr. Thomas Stockman, in the role of an enlightened and persecuted minority of one confronting an ignorant, powerful majority. When the physician learns that the famous and financially successful baths in his hometown are contaminated, he insists they be shut down for expensive repairs. For his honesty, he is persecuted, ridiculed, and declared an \"enemy of the people\" by the townspeople, included some who have been his closest allies.

I say written FOR children because the new psychological business of writing ABOUT them as though they were small pills or hatched in some especially scientific method is extremely popular today. Writing for children rather than about them is very difficult as everybody who has tried it knows. It can only be done, I am convinced, by somebody having a great deal of the child in his own outlook and sensibilities. Such was the author of \"The Little Duke\" and \"The Dove in the Eagle's Nest,\" such the author of \"A Flatiron for a Farthing,\" and \"The Story of a Short Life.\" Such, above all, the author of \"Alice in Wonderland.\" Grownups imagine that they can do the trick by adopting baby language and talking down to their very critical audience. There never was a greater mistake. The imagination of the author must be a child's imagination and yet maturely consistent, so that the White Queen in \"Alice,\" for instance, is seen just as a child would see her, but she continues always herself through all her distressing adventures.
