Her concern with language as subject, with character as an expression of social role, with plot as a mechanism that may ensnare rather than locate the self, mode her very much a modern. In Trifles (1916) she developed a feminist critique of social role. In The Outside (1917) she staged a debate between the life force and a perverse celebration of death. In both plays silence becomes an eloquent expression of meaning. The Verge (1921) is an experimental work of considerable proportions, more daring in many ways than anything attempted by O'Neill. Though Inheritors (1921) is far more conventional it touched a contemporary nerve, questioning the nature and reality of American pieties.

Though Grant opens with tales of his boyhood, his education at West Point, and his early military career in the Mexican-American war of the 1840s, it is Grant's intimate observations on the conduct of the Civil War, which make up the bulk of the work, that have made this required reading for history students, military strategists, and Civil War buffs alike.

A wealthy English financier living in France, Renauld hints at being in possession of a deadly secret. The Belgian sleuth \u2014 accompanied by Captain Hastings, his friend from The Mysterious Affair at Styles \u2014 rushes to answer the call but arrives too late. Stabbed in the back, Poirot's would-be client lies in a shallow grave on the golf course alongside his estate. Renauld's wife, found bound and gagged in her bedroom, identifies a pair of masked intruders as the likeliest culprits. But the thugs prove untraceable even as the roster of suspects expands. The instant dislike formed between Poirot and Monsieur Giraud of the Paris S\u00fbret\u00e9 further intensifies the investigation, which becomes a competition between their radically different approaches to crime detection. Both are incapable of solving the murder until the discovery of a second corpse, slain in the same manner as the first, provides fresh clues. Agatha Christie's lively and stylish whodunit offers mystery lovers an abundance of twists and turns as well as a dash of romance.", "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2019-01-16", "publisher": "Dover Publications", "isbn13": "9780486829234", "isbn10": "0486829235"}]
