To this end I made several rough copies, jotting down explanatory notes detailing the technique of different instruments. What I intended to present to the world on this subject, was to include everything. The writing of this treatise, or, to be more exact, the sketch for it took up most of my time in the years 1873 and 1874. After reading the works of Tyndall and Helmholtz, I framed an introduction to my work, in which I endeavoured to expound the laws of acoustics as applied to the principles governing the construction of musical instruments. My manual was to begin with a detailed list of instruments, classified in groups and tabulated, including a description of the various systems in use at the present day. I had not yet thought of the second part of the book which was to be devoted to instruments in combination. But I soon realised that I had gone too far. With wind instruments in particular, the different systems were innumerable, and each manufacturer favoured his own pet theory. By the addition of a certain key the maker endowed his instrument with the possibility of a new trill, and made some difficult passages more playable than on an instrument of another kind. \"There was no end to such complications. In the brass, I found instruments with three, four, and five valves, the mechanism varying according to the make. Obviously, I could not hope to cover so large a field; besides, of what value would such a treatise be to the student? Such a mass of detailed description of the various systems, their advantages and drawbacks, could not but fail to confuse the reader only too eager to learn. Naturally he would wish to know what instrument to employ, the extent of its capabilities etc., and getting no satisfactory information he would throw my massive work aside. For these reasons my interest in the book gradually waned, and finally I gave up the task.\"", "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2015-09-13", "publisher": "Library of Alexandria", "isbn13": "9781465604118", "isbn10": "1465604111"}, {"title": "Spenser's The Faerie Queene, Book I", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/15272.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/15272.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Spenser, Edmund"}, "create": {"name": "Spenser, Edmund", "birthYear": 1551, "deathYear": 1599}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": []}, "description": null, "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "1758", "publisher": null}, {"title": "The Age of Innocence", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/541.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/541.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Wharton, Edith"}, "create": {"name": "Wharton, Edith", "birthYear": 1862, "deathYear": 1937}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Bestsellers, American, 1895-1923"}, "create": {"name": "Bestsellers, American, 1895-1923"}}, {"where": {"name": "Movie Books"}, "create": {"name": "Movie Books"}}]}, "description": "Complementing the complete text of Wharton s landmark novel, this extensive volume also includes a wealth of contextual material. \"Background Readings\" explores the culture of 1870s New York, as depicted in the novel, as well as views on marriage and divorce at that time.

The grotesque hunchback Quasimodo, bell-ringer of Notre-Dame, owes his life to the austere archdeacon, Claude Frollo, who in turn is bound by a hopeless passion to the gypsy dancer Esmeralda. She, meanwhile, is bewitched by a handsome, empty-headed officer, but by an unthinking act of kindness wins Quasimodo's selfless devotion. Behind the central figures moves a pageant of picturesque characters, ranging from the cruel, superstitious king, Louis XI, to the underworld of beggars and petty criminals. These disreputable truands' night-time assault on the cathedral is one of the most spectacular set-pieces of Romantic literature. Hugo vividly depicts medieval Paris, where all life is dominated by the massive cathedral. His passionate enthusiasm for Gothic architecture is set within the context of an epic view of mankind's history, to which he attaches even more importance than to the novel's compelling story. Alban Krailsheimer's new translation is a fresh approach to this monumental classic by France's most celebrated Romantic.

The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it absorbs and reflects no light and thus becomes invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but fails in his attempt to reverse the procedure. Instead, his plight becomes known. When he attempts to enlist the aid of former acquaintance, he is betrayed. So Griffin decides to murder his betrayer and begin a \"Reign of Terror\".", "rating": 3.5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2012-02", "publisher": "CreateSpace", "isbn10": "1470080923", "isbn13": "9781470080921"}, {"title": "Pascal's Pens\u00e9es", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/18269.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/18269.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Pascal, Blaise"}, "create": {"name": "Pascal, Blaise", "birthYear": 1623, "deathYear": 1662}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Banned Books from Anne Haight's list"}, "create": {"name": "Banned Books from Anne Haight's list"}}, {"where": {"name": "Harvard Classics"}, "create": {"name": "Harvard Classics"}}]}, "description": "Blaise Pascal's famous Pens es (Thoughts) is, in reality, a collection of notes he made for a book he never wrote.

His mother could neither read nor write while his father, William, was a factory knitter. In 1903, Allen published his third and most famous book As a Man Thinketh. ''Men do not attract what they want, but what they are.'' ''A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.'' ''Cherish your visions. Cherish your ideals. Cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all heavenly environment, of these, if you but remain true to them your world will at last be built.'' ''The soul attracts that which it secretly harbors, that which it loves, and also that which it fears. It reaches the height of its cherished aspirations. It falls to the level of its unchastened desires - and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own.'' ''Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves, they therefore remain bound.'' ''Every action and feeling is preceded by a thought.'' ''Right thinking begins with the words we say to ourselves.'' ''Circumstance does not make the man, it reveals him to himself.'' ''You cannot travel within and stand still without.'' ''As the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful and patient training, so the man of weak thoughts, can make them strong by exercising himself in right thinking.''
