The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of the British Regency. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London.Page 2 of a letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first mentions Pride and Prejudice, using its working title First Impressions.Set in England in the early 19th century, Pride and Prejudice tells the story of Mr and Mrs Bennet's five unmarried daughters after the rich and eligible Mr Bingley and his status-conscious friend, Mr Darcy, have moved into their neighbourhood. While Bingley takes an immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, Darcy has difficulty adapting to local society and repeatedly clashes with the second-eldest Bennet daughter, Elizabeth.Though Austen set the story at the turn of the 19th century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of \"most loved books.\" It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, selling over 20 million copies, and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen's memorable characters or themes.", "rating": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2014-11-29", "publisher": null, "isbn10": "1503290565", "isbn13": "9781503290563"}, {"title": "The Great Gatsby", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/64317.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/64317.epub.images.epub.jpeg", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Fitzgerald, F.

First published on December 17, 1843 as a novella, the story bestowed on Christmas its rich and complicated social character. Ebenezer\u2019s epic Christmas Eve illustrates both the joy to be found in friends, family, and festive gatherings... and the dangers of letting such happiness and privilege blind you to the lives of the less fortunate. The story is a product of its time, a response to the ills of Victorian-era industrialization and the desire for tradition, but you only need to look at how varied the adaptations of A Christmas Carol have become--on stage, in film, and in song--to know that it is truly timeless. This exclusive edition of A Christmas Carol in Prose: Being a Ghost Story of Christmas is one adaptation not to miss. It is a scanned volume of the original novella--complete with original spooky title--enhanced with new illustrations and narration by artist and musician Jon Langford. Here Langford imagines the story as a stage production put on by a small West Yorkshire theater in 1916.
