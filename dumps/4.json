Learning from those who have walked the path and fought the fight brings wisdom and strengthens resolve. And hearing the familiar chords of kingdom living sung by voices from other times can penetrate cultural barriers that limit our allegiance to the King. To this end, Moody Publishers is honored to introduce the first six volumes in what is to be an ongoing series of spiritual classics.

The story first appeared in the January 1962 issue of the pulp sci-fi magazine Worlds of If. Its modest utopian beginnings quickly open up to an underlying dystopia: the only way to maintain the perfect balance on this seemingly perfect far-future Earth is to limit the population to precisely forty million souls. But old age has been beaten. To maintain eternal happiness, should birth control fail, one must acquiesce to either infanticide or suicide - choose your pleasure. Those few adults who decide they want to die are encouraged to call the Federal Bureau of Termination's hotline at 2 B R 0 2 B (pronounced 2 B or naught 2 B) and make an appointment for euthanasia, thus opening the door for the birth of a new human.

He documented the destructive First Jewish-Roman War, which destroyed Jerusalem in 70 A.D., and he was one of the first historians to discuss Christians. His best known works include The Jewish War (circa 75 AD) and Antiquities of the Jews (circa 94 AD). Antiquities of the Jews was written from the perspective of Jews and intended for Roman audiences.
