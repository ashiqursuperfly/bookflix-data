In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and H. G. Wells was moved to decry James Joyce's \"cloacal obsession.\" None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, Ulysses is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language. Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: What happens? In the case of Ulysses, the answer might be Everything. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the books stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes Ulysses not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism.", "rating": 3.5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2016-06-01", "publisher": "Aegitas", "isbn13": "9781773130446", "isbn10": "1773130447"}, {"title": "The Philippines a Century Hence", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/35899.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/35899.epub.images.epub.jpeg", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Rizal, Jos\u00e9"}, "create": {"name": "Rizal, Jos\u00e9", "birthYear": 1861, "deathYear": 1896}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": []}, "description": null, "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "1912", "publisher": null}, {"title": "Wuthering Heights", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/768.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/768.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Bront\u00eb, Emily"}, "create": {"name": "Bront\u00eb, Emily", "birthYear": 1818, "deathYear": 1848}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Best Books Ever Listings"}, "create": {"name": "Best Books Ever Listings"}}, {"where": {"name": "Gothic Fiction"}, "create": {"name": "Gothic Fiction"}}, {"where": {"name": "Movie Books"}, "create": {"name": "Movie Books"}}]}, "description": null, "rating": 3.5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "1847", "publisher": null, "isbn10": "8172344899", "isbn13": "9788172344894"}, {"title": "The Iliad", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/6130.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/6130.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Homer"}, "create": {"name": "Homer", "birthYear": -750, "deathYear": -650}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Classical Antiquity"}, "create": {"name": "Classical Antiquity"}}]}, "description": "A new translation of Homer's ancient masterpiece endeavors to instill the poetic nature of its original language while retaining accuracy, readability, and character vibrancy.", "rating": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2011-10-11", "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "isbn13": "9781439163375", "isbn10": "1439163375"}, {"title": "The Odyssey: Rendered into English prose for the use of those who cannot read the original", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/1727.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/1727.epub.images.epub.jpeg", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Homer"}, "create": {"name": "Homer", "birthYear": -750, "deathYear": -650}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Classical Antiquity"}, "create": {"name": "Classical Antiquity"}}, {"where": {"name": "Harvard Classics"}, "create": {"name": "Harvard Classics"}}]}, "description": null, "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "1900", "publisher": null}, {"title": "Little Women", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/514.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/514.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Alcott, Louisa May"}, "create": {"name": "Alcott, Louisa May", "birthYear": 1832, "deathYear": 1888}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Children's Literature"}, "create": {"name": "Children's Literature"}}]}, "description": "Little Women is a novel by American author Louisa May Alcott (1832\u20131888), which was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869. Alcott wrote the books rapidly over several months at the request of her publisher. The novel follows the lives of four sisters\u2014Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March\u2014detailing their passage from childhood to womanhood, and is loosely based on the author and her three sisters.Little Women was an immediate commercial and critical success, and readers demanded to know more about the characters. Alcott quickly completed a second volume, entitled Good Wives. It was also successful. The two volumes were issued in 1880 in a single work entitled Little Women. Alcott also wrote two sequels to her popular work, both of which also featured the March sisters: Little Men (1871) and Jo's Boys (1886). Although Little Women was a novel for girls, it differed notably from the current writings for children, especially girls. The novel addressed three major themes: \"domesticity, work, and true love, all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine's individual identity.\"Little Women \"has been read as a romance or as a quest, or both. It has been read as a family drama that validates virtue over wealth\", but also \"as a means of escaping that life by women who knew its gender constraints only too well\". According to Sarah Elbert, Alcott created a new form of literature, one that took elements from Romantic children's fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels, resulting in a totally new format. Elbert argued that within Little Women can be found the first vision of the \"All-American girl\" and that her multiple aspects are embodied in the differing March sisters.", "rating": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2014-11-29", "publisher": "Createspace Independent Pub", "isbn10": "1503280292", "isbn13": "9781503280298"}, {"title": "Noli Me Tangere", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/20228.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/20228.epub.images.epub.jpeg", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Rizal, Jos\u00e9"}, "create": {"name": "Rizal, Jos\u00e9", "birthYear": 1861, "deathYear": 1896}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": []}, "description": "\"The Noli,\" as it is called in the Philippines, was the first artistic manifestation of Asian resistance to European colonialism, and Rizal became a guiding conscience - and martyr - for the revolution that would rise up in the Spanish province.

In this collection of essays, first published together in 1903, he eloquently affirms that it is beneath the dignity of a human being to beg for those rights that belong inherently to all mankind. He also charges that the strategy of accommodation to white supremacy advanced by Booker T. Washington, then the most influential black leader in America, would only serve to perpetuate black oppression. Publication of The Souls of Black Folk was a dramatic event that helped to polarize black leaders into two groups: the more conservative followers of Washington and the more radical supporters of aggressive protest. Its influence cannot be overstated.
