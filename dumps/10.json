The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of the British Regency. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London.Page 2 of a letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first mentions Pride and Prejudice, using its working title First Impressions.Set in England in the early 19th century, Pride and Prejudice tells the story of Mr and Mrs Bennet's five unmarried daughters after the rich and eligible Mr Bingley and his status-conscious friend, Mr Darcy, have moved into their neighbourhood. While Bingley takes an immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, Darcy has difficulty adapting to local society and repeatedly clashes with the second-eldest Bennet daughter, Elizabeth.Though Austen set the story at the turn of the 19th century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of \"most loved books.\" It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, selling over 20 million copies, and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen's memorable characters or themes.", "rating": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2014-11-29", "publisher": null, "isbn10": "1503290565", "isbn13": "9781503290563"}, {"title": "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/1514.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/1514.epub.images.epub.jpeg", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Shakespeare, William"}, "create": {"name": "Shakespeare, William", "birthYear": 1564, "deathYear": 1616}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": []}, "description": "Shakespeare's intertwined love polygons begin to get complicated from the start\u2014Demetrius and Lysander both want Hermia but she only has eyes for Lysander.

Demons is an 1872 novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Though titled The Possessed in the initial English translation, Dostoyevsky scholars and later translations favour the titles The Devils or Demons. An extremely political book, Demons is a testimonial of life in Imperial Russia in the late 19th century. As the revolutionary democrats begin to rise in Russia, different ideologies begin to collide. Dostoyevsky casts a critical eye on both the liberal idealists, portraying their ideas and ideological foundation as demonic, and the conservative establishment's ineptitude in dealing with those ideas and their social consequences. The entire novel takes place in a small town outside of Petersberg and is narrated by a man named Mr. Govorov. Mr. Govorov does not witness every conversation first hand, but nonetheless the narrator describes the story as if he partook in every situation or as a chronicler, who had the events described to him. We know very little of Mr. Govorov, except that he is a close friend of Stephan Trofimovich. Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky ( 1821 \u2013 1881) was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist and philosopher. Dostoyevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the context of the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmosphere of 19th-century Russia.

It tells of Adam and Eve's first dwelling - the Cave of Treasures; their trials and temptations; Satan's many apparitions to them; the birth of Cain, Abel, and their twin sisters; and Cain's love for his beautiful twin sister, Luluwa, whom Adam and Eve wished to join to Abel. This book is considered by many scholars to be part of the \"Pseudepigrapha\" (soo-duh-pig-ruh-fuh). The \"Pseudepigrapha\" is a collection of historical biblical works that are considered to be fiction. Because of that stigma, this book was not included in the compilation of the Holy Bible. This book is a written history of what happened in the days of Adam and Eve after they were cast out of the garden. Although considered to be pseudepigraphic by some, it carries significant meaning and insight into events of that time. It is doubtful that these writings could have survived all the many centuries if there were no substance to them. This book is simply a version of an account handed down by word of mouth, from generation to generation, linking the time that the first human life was created to the time when somebody finally decided to write it down. This particular version is the work of unknown Egyptians. The lack of historical allusion makes it difficult to precisely date the writing, however, using other pseudepigraphical works as a reference, it was probably written a few hundred years before the birth of Christ. Parts of this version are found in the Jewish Talmud, and the Islamic Koran, showing what a vital role it played in the original literature of human wisdom. The Egyptian author wrote in Arabic, but later translations were found written in Ethiopic. The present English translation was translated in the late 1800's by Dr. S. C. Malan and Dr. E. Trumpp. They translated into King James English from both the Arabic version and the Ethiopic version which was then published in The Forgotten Books of Eden in 1927 by The World Publishing Company. In 1995, the text was extracted from a copy of The Forgotten Books of Eden and converted to electronic form by Dennis Hawkins. It was then translated into more modern English by simply exchanging 'Thou' s for 'You's, 'Art's for 'Are's, and so forth. The text was then carefully re-read to ensure its integrity.", "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2019-10-25", "publisher": null, "isbn10": "1989708935", "isbn13": "9781989708934"}, {"title": "Poems by Emily Dickinson, Three Series, Complete", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/12242.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/12242.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Dickinson, Emily"}, "create": {"name": "Dickinson, Emily", "birthYear": 1830, "deathYear": 1886}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Bibliomania"}, "create": {"name": "Bibliomania"}}]}, "description": "The complete three volumes of poetry by Emily Dickinson.

He was born in Rome to an ancient and prominent family which included emperors Petronius Maximus and Olybrius and many consuls. His father, Flavius Manlius Boethius, was consul in 487 after Odoacer deposed the last Western Roman Emperor. Boethius, of the noble Anicia family, entered public life at a young age and was already a senator by the age of 25. Boethius himself was consul in 510 in the kingdom of the Ostrogoths. In 522 he saw his two sons become consuls. Boethius was imprisoned and eventually executed by King Theodoric the Great, who suspected him of conspiring with the Eastern Roman Empire.

You may be witched by his sunlight, -transported by the bright gildings in the skies he builds over you; but there is the blackness of darkness beyond; and even his bright gildings but fringe and play upon the edges of thunder-clouds.\"\"", "rating": 4.5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2017-07-08", "publisher": "Lulu.com", "isbn13": "9781387088874", "isbn10": "1387088874"}, {"title": "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: With Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/3420.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/3420.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Wollstonecraft, Mary"}, "create": {"name": "Wollstonecraft, Mary", "birthYear": 1759, "deathYear": 1797}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Best Books Ever Listings"}, "create": {"name": "Best Books Ever Listings"}}]}, "description": null, "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "1793", "publisher": null}, {"title": "A Princess of Mars", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/62.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/62.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Burroughs, Edgar Rice"}, "create": {"name": "Burroughs, Edgar Rice", "birthYear": 1875, "deathYear": 1950}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Best Books Ever Listings"}, "create": {"name": "Best Books Ever Listings"}}, {"where": {"name": "Science Fiction"}, "create": {"name": "Science Fiction"}}]}, "description": "A Virginia gentleman finds himself transported from Civil War-era America to Mars, where he plots, along with the lovely Princess of Theluim, to escape from his savage green captors", "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "1963", "publisher": "Barsoom"}, {"title": "Vanity Fair", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/599.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/599.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Thackeray, William Makepeace"}, "create": {"name": "Thackeray, William Makepeace", "birthYear": 1811, "deathYear": 1863}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Harvard Classics"}, "create": {"name": "Harvard Classics"}}, {"where": {"name": "Historical Fiction"}, "create": {"name": "Historical Fiction"}}]}, "description": "Thackeray's most representative novel - a picture of society on a broad scale, with Becky Sharp, the adventuress, a principal character.

Its founder was Zeno of Cytium (not to be confused with Zeno of Elea, who discovered the famous paradoxes). He was born in Cyprus about 336 b.c., but all of his philosophical activity took place in Athens. For more than 500 years Stoicism was one of the most influential and fruitful philosophical movements in the Graeco-Roman world. The works of the earlier Stoics survive only in fragmentary quotations from other authors, but from the Renaissance until well into the nineteenth century, Stoic ethical thought was one of the most important ancient influences on European ethics, particularly because of the descriptions of it by Cicero, through surviving works by the Stoics Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and also Epictetus--and also because of the effect that it had had in antiquity, and continued to have into the nineteenth century, on Christian ethical views. Nowadays an undergraduate or graduate student learning about ancient philosophy in a university course may well hear only about Plato and Aristotle, along perhaps with the presocratics; but in the history of Western thought and education this situation is somewhat atypical, and in most periods a comparable student would have learned as much or more about Stoicism, as well as two other major ancient philosophical movements, Epicureanism and Scepticism. In spite of this lack of explicit acquaintance with Stoic philosophers and their works, however, most students will recognize in Epictetus various ideas that are familiar through their effects on other thinkers, notably Spinoza, in our intellectual tradition.\"", "rating": 3.5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "1983", "publisher": "Hackett Publishing", "isbn10": "0915145693", "isbn13": "9780915145690"}, {"title": "The Cosmic Looters", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/65331.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/65331.epub.images.epub.jpeg", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Hamilton, Edmond"}, "create": {"name": "Hamilton, Edmond", "birthYear": 1904, "deathYear": 1977}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": []}, "description": "Armchair Fiction presents extra large editions of classic science fiction double novels.

After being violently awakened in the middle of the night by a beautiful, black-haired woman from outer space, Wyatt was informed of an imminent attack upon his world. But Wyatt knew his government wouldn't believe it--he didn't believe it. So who was this strange woman and what were her real motivations? After hitching a ride in her spacecraft, Wyatt found himself hurtling through the void to the Alpha Centauri system--all in his stocking feet! He was soon witness to a large-scale planetary attack--a vicious raid for plunder--on a slightly less advanced, but no less civilized planet than his home planet, Earth. So with the fate of Earth hanging in the balance, Wyatt plotted a course for the races of two worlds to finally put an end to the empirical conquests of the Cosmic Looters. The second novel, \"Wandl the Invader\" was penned by another top-of-the-line sci-fi author, Ray Cummings. Interplanetary warfare erupts! There were nine major planets in the Solar System and it was within their boundaries that man first set up interplanetary commerce and began trading with the ancient Martian civilization. And then they discovered a tenth planet--a maverick! This tenth world, if it had an orbit, had a strange one, for it was heading inwards from interstellar space, heading close to the Earth-Mars spaceways, upsetting astronautic calculations and raising turmoil on the two inhabited worlds. But even so none suspected then just how much trouble this new world would make. For it was WANDL THE INVADER and it was no barren planetoid.

Wharton creates a portrait of a stunning beauty who, though raised and educated to marry well both socially and economically, is reaching her 29th year, an age when her youthful blush is drawing to a close and her marital prospects are becoming ever more limited. The House of Mirth traces Lily's slow two-year social descent from privilege to a tragically lonely existence on the margins of society. Wharton uses Lily as an attack on \"\"an irresponsible, grasping and morally corrupt upper class.\"\" Before publication as a book on October 14, 1905, The House of Mirth was serialized in Scribner's Magazine beginning in January 1905.
