The book documents Jacobs' life as a slave and how she gained freedom for herself and for her children. Jacobs contributed to the genre of slave narrative by using the techniques of sentimental novels \"to address race and gender issues.\" She explores the struggles and sexual abuse that female slaves faced on plantations as well as their efforts to practice motherhood and protect their children when their children might be sold away.Jacobs' book is addressed to white women in the North who do not fully comprehend the evils of slavery. She makes direct appeals to their humanity to expand their knowledge and influence their thoughts about slavery as an institution.", "rating": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "1861", "publisher": null}, {"title": "Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/11231.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/11231.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Melville, Herman"}, "create": {"name": "Melville, Herman", "birthYear": 1819, "deathYear": 1891}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": []}, "description": "Ever Felt Alone, Surrounded by People...'

The story takes place in multiple settings, the first of which is heaven. Mephistopheles makes a bet with God \u2013 he says that he can lure God's favorite human being \u2013 Faust, who is striving to learn everything that can be known, away from righteous pursuits. Faust makes an arrangement with the devil \u2013 the devil will do everything that Faust wants while he is here on Earth, and in exchange Faust will serve the devil in Hell. In Faust, Goethe focuses on social phenomena such as psychology, history and politics, in addition to mystical and philosophical topics. Faust does not seek power through knowledge, but access to transcendent knowledge incomprehensible to the rational being. Here Goethe's mysticism asserts itself clearly. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) was a German writer and statesman, best known for his tragic play, Faust. His body of work includes epic and lyric poetry written in a variety of meters and styles, prose and verse dramas, memoirs, literary and aesthetic criticism, novels, numerous literary and scientific fragments and many more. A literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, following the success of his first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther. He was also an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement.", "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2017-05-05", "publisher": "e-artnow", "isbn13": "9788075831767", "isbn10": "8075831764"}, {"title": "Repertory of The Comedie Humaine, Complete, A \u2014 Z", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/17635.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/17635.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Cerfberr, Anatole"}, "create": {"name": "Cerfberr, Anatole", "birthYear": 1835, "deathYear": 1896}}, {"where": {"name": "Christophe, Jules Fran\u00e7ois"}, "create": {"name": "Christophe, Jules Fran\u00e7ois", "birthYear": 1840, "deathYear": null}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": []}, "description": "This book is part of the TREDITION CLASSICS series.
