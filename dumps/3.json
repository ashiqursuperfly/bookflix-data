And John Lesslie Hall\u2019s biography and his works. Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or palace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents. The joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the monster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of joyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and anon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong enough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he persecutes Hrothgar and his vassals. Over sea, a day\u2019s voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac, king of the Geats, hears of Grendel\u2019s doings and of Hrothgar\u2019s misery. He resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With fourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that country, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours that elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When Hrothgar\u2019s bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling him that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his palace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms. Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God\u2019s anger. He seizes and kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf. A fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used, both combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears Grendel\u2019s shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den, howling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal. The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall Heorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts. Grendel\u2019s mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She is furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar\u2019s favorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is called. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and goes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the waters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her den. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal struggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking with him Grendel\u2019s head. Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar literally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among the vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord. Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure. When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a distinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour. Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he has been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried by a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing struggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is inexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor the memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is burnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national hero of Geatland. The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness, his goodness of heart, and his generosity.", "rating": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "1892", "publisher": "D.C.

Dort verlebt er eine bedr\u00fcckende Zeit und wird bereits als Zehnj\u00e4hriger zur Fabrikarbeit gezwungen. Elend und Ausbeutung stehen im Zeitalter der bl\u00fchenden Industrialisierung auf der Tagesordnung, und David kann sich den unertr\u00e4glichen Bedingungen nur durch die Flucht zu seiner Tante Betsey entziehen. Obwohl diese ihn kaum kennt, nimmt sie ihn herzlich auf. Nach entbehrungsreicher Zeit scheint sich das Blatt zu wenden und der Junge kann eine gute Schule besuchen. Wie Dickens wird er sp\u00e4ter selbst Anwaltsgehilfe, Reporter und schliesslich erfolgreicher Schriftsteller. \"David Copperfield\" gilt als einer der bedeutendsten Kindheits- und Jugendromane der Weltliteratur. Er zeigt Dickens' \u00fcberragendes Talent f\u00fcr die Darstellung von Stimmungen, Erlebnissen und Gef\u00fchlen seiner Figuren. Das 1849/1850 zun\u00e4chst in Fortsetzungen erschienene Werk weist viele autobiografische Z\u00fcge auf und gilt als Lieblingsroman des ber\u00fchmten englischen Schriftstellers. Charles Dickens wurde am 7. Februar 1812 in Landport bei Portsea in England geboren. Nach einer harten Jugend begann er seine schriftstellerische Laufbahn mit Skizzen, die er unter dem Pseudonym Boz in Londoner Zeitungen und Magazinen ver\u00f6ffentlichte. Die .Pickwick Papers' machten ihn 1837 weltber\u00fchmt. All seine grossen Romane schrieb er in fieberhaftem Tempo. 1868 kaufte Dickens - er war inzwischen der gefeiertste Dichter seiner Zeit - Gadshill Place, von nun an sein st\u00e4ndiger Wohnsitz.

A terrifying answer to man's eternal questions, this monumental work remains the crowning achievement of perhaps the finest novelist of all time.

He is regarded as one of the key literary figures of the 19th century. James is known especially for the novels in which he portrays Americans encountering Europeans. His style of writing, often verbose and indirect, can make him difficult to read. Often, too, he writes from the point of view of the characters within a tale, exploring issues related to consciousness and perception. His imaginative use of point of view, interior monologue, and narrators who were not necessarily reliable, brought depth and interest to his fiction. The Aspern Papers is one of his most notable short novels, along with The Turn of the Screw. In addition to fiction he published articles,books of travel, autobiography, biography, criticism, and plays. Among his masterpieces are Daisy Miller (1879), The Portrait of a Lady (1881), The Bostonians (1886), What Maisie Knew (1897), The Wings of the Dove (1902), and The Golden Bowl (1916), several of which are available in this series, Classics Condense by Cowley.", "rating": null, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "yearPublished": "2015-12-09", "publisher": "iUniverse", "isbn13": "9781491783740", "isbn10": "1491783745"}, {"title": "Don Juan", "copyright": false, "fileUrl": "books/21700.epub.images.epub", "fileType": "epub", "coverImageUrl": "book-covers/21700.epub.images.epub.png", "authors": {"connectOrCreate": [{"where": {"name": "Byron, George Gordon Byron, Baron"}, "create": {"name": "Byron, George Gordon Byron, Baron", "birthYear": 1788, "deathYear": 1824}}]}, "genres": {"connectOrCreate": []}, "description": "Byrons exuberant masterpiece tells of the adventures of Don Juan, beginning with his illicit love affair at the age of sixteen in his native Spain and his subsequent exile to Italy.
